## Hi there 👋

I am a Research Assistant at University of Trento, supervised by Professor Raffaella Bernardi (University of Bolzano).
I am currently working on using mechanistic interpretability techniques to understand the differences induced by finetuning on models after being trained on interactive tasks.  

I am interested mostly in evaluating and improving LLMs’ agentic capabilities, and understanding how performing actions in controlled environments can affect their social and reasoning capabilities.
I am also interested in the role language feedback in learning, and how we can develop effective feedback signals for increasing sample efficiency.

I am based in South Korea (Daejeon), and I am in the job market for both Industry and Academic opportunities!
