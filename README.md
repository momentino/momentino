## Hi there 👋

I am a Research Assistant at University of Trento, supervised by Professor Raffaella Bernardi (University of Bolzano).  
I am currently exploring ways to improve LLMs' of using language to act (rather than just understanding its formal rules).

I've found in games, thanks to their goal-oriented and multi-turn nature, valuable proxies for many real-world tasks.
I am highly interested in the interactive aspect of such setups, and in particular in the role that language feedback may have to improve models' sample efficiency.

Throughout my Master, I have got the pleasure to participate to an international project aimed at building tools to support LLMs' learning in interactive games which led to the publication of two papers at EMNLP 2025.

I am open to both positions in the industry and in academia, with high interest in multi-disciplinary projects and teams.

I am based in South Korea (Daejeon), and I am in the job market for both Industry and Academic opportunities!
